Welcome to BackupSystemTest ! 
This is a project that let me show you a bit of my skills as a Web Developmer.
To install this project, make sure that the database credentials that are stored in app/api/databaseconnection.php are correct
Then, import dbschema.sql (Which is the DB structure) and then dbdata.sql (Test data).
You will need Node.js and npm to install the project

First, after cloning project from Github, run "npm install", then "npm run dev". This will normaly create a "/dist" folder at the root of the project.
This dist directory is where the project with the JS/CSS... files will be merged into a single file called bundle.js
This is where the index.html should be loaded for testing.

In my computer, I enter "localhost/dist" to access the project.
